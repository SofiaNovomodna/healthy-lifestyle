    <h1>Healthy lifestyle</h1>

<h3>Nutrition:</h3>

<p>Good nutrition is vital to maintaining overall health and wellness. A balanced diet helps prevent chronic diseases and supports body function. Here’s how you can eat healthily:
Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables: Aim to fill half of your plate with colorful fruits and veggies. They provide essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber.
Choose whole grains: Brown rice, whole-wheat pasta, and oats are better than refined grains. Whole grains are high in fiber and help with digestion.
Incorporate lean proteins: Include sources like fish, chicken, legumes, tofu, and eggs for muscle building and repair.
Limit processed foods and added sugars: Processed foods often contain unhealthy fats, excess sugar, and sodium. Opt for fresh, whole foods instead.
Tip: Drink plenty of water throughout the day. A good rule of thumb is to drink at least 8 cups of water daily.</p>

<h3>Exercise:</h3>

<p>Exercise is essential for maintaining physical and mental health. It helps with weight management, improves heart health, boosts energy, and enhances mood. Here's how to stay active:
Strength Training: Incorporating weightlifting or bodyweight exercises (such as push-ups, squats, lunges) into your routine 2–3 times per week helps build muscle and improve metabolism.
Cardiovascular Exercise: Activities like walking, jogging, cycling, swimming, or dancing improve heart health and burn calories. Aim for 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise weekly.
Flexibility and Balance: Practices like yoga, Pilates, or simple stretching exercises help with flexibility, reduce muscle stiffness, and enhance balance.
Tip: Find something you enjoy! The best exercise routine is the one you'll stick with long-term.</p>

<h3>Sleep:</h3>

<p>Sleep is a key component of a healthy lifestyle. It allows the body to recover, rejuvenate, and function at its best. Here's why sleep is essential:
Improve cognitive function: Adequate sleep improves concentration, memory, and emotional regulation.
Boost immunity: Your body uses sleep time to repair cells and strengthen the immune system.
Regulate hormones: Sleep affects hormones related to appetite, stress, and energy levels. Poor sleep can lead to weight gain, mood swings, and fatigue.
Tip: Establish a bedtime routine, avoid screens an hour before sleep, and keep your bedroom cool and dark to improve sleep quality.</p>
